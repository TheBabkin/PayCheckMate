### PayCheckMate is android studio project written in Kotlin, implementing some of the latest Jetpack features.

This project was made for a friend who wanted an application similar to notes, but with additional fields to keep track of his work related affairs. Whiles developing this app I followed Googles guidelines and used some of the latest librearies from [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) and recommended design pattern **MVVM**.

Some of [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) libraries used in this project are:
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room)
* [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose)
* [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/navigation)
